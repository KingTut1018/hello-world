My first repository: Hello World

Hello everyone!

Sean here, I am looking to go for my Masters in Computer Science and switch career paths from recruitment and office management to more technical roles. I have taken Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, HTML5, and CSS courses so far. Look forward to learning more and interacting with a great community!
